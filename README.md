# mva-random-matrices

(Report is in french).

This repository contains the code and the report linked to a TP on random matrices.

The report contains all the theoretical details and the notebook shows real examples.

The main goal of this TP was to study spectral community detection on graph with a very large number of nodes using random matrices results on limiting distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
